# Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition System

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can recognize human emotions in real-time by analyzing both facial expressions (visual data) and voice tone (audio data). By fusing these two modalities, the system aims to achieve enhanced accuracy in emotion detection and classification.

### 2. Key Features

#### **Visual Emotion Recognition**
- Detect faces in real-time using a connected camera.
- Classify facial expressions into categories such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral using a pre-trained or custom deep learning model.

#### **Audio Emotion Recognition**
- Capture audio input via a microphone.
- Extract features like pitch, tone, and intensity to classify emotions.

#### **Multimodal Fusion**
- Combine visual and audio data using a fusion algorithm to improve emotion recognition accuracy.

#### **Output**
- Display the detected emotion on a screen or send it to a mobile app.
- Provide real-time feedback through visual or audio cues.

- Optimize models to run efficiently on low-resource hardware while maintaining real-time performance.

#### **4) Preprocessing on Embedded Devices**
- Apply machine learning on embedded devices for data preprocessing.
- Transmit preprocessed data to a central, high-capacity machine learning system for further analysis and decision-making.
